This project has been made for the exam of Intelligent Agents of University of Turin. It has been written using Kotlin using the [ModernAgent](https://github.com/lamba92/jade-modern-agent) library.

The project is the example of `ContractNet` protocol to assign the conversion of a video file using `ffmpeg`.
